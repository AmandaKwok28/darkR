# darkR

darkR is an RStudio theme file designed to emulate the GitHub Dark default theme. This project was created for personal use, inspired by my preference for the GitHub dark color scheme. It consists solely of an `rstheme` file.

**Disclaimer:** I have little experience in CSS so the code may contain some redundancies due to messy edits. The `rstheme` file is based on an edited version of Ben Harrap's, available [here](https://github.com/benharrap/rsthemes.git).

Ben Harrap also provides a useful tutorial on creating and modifying `rstheme` files if you want to develop your own theme.

## Installation

You can install the development version of darkR using Git:

```bash
cd /your/personal/directory
git clone https://github.com/AmandaKwok28/darkR.git

Another (probably easier option) : 
You can also download the file directly and save it in your directory

## Usage

To use the rstheme, open Rstudio and hit tools --> Global Options --> Appearance then in the 
drop-down list of editor themes, the Add... button and navigate to the rsthemes file you just
downloaded. Finally, hit apply. 


## How to Modify

To modify this rstheme file, open the rstheme file in Rstudio. Rstudio has 4 boxes that open up.
In the top left box (the editor), navigate to it's bottom right corner and there should be a menu
that allows you to change the language of your file. Make sure to set that to CSS so that R knows 
how to read it. This allows gives you a preview of all the hexadecimal colors in the file so you
don't need to apply the theme everytime to check your colors.

To actually apply the theme, navigate to editor themes (as detailed in Usage section) and remove your 
theme then re-add it. Hit apply and the changes should show.
